# Elevator_ctrllr_using_FPGA
Elevator Controller using Altera FPGA

This design involves the development of a VERILOG RTL code to manage elevator movement based on user requests. A Finite State Machine is employed to determine the transitions between states as the controller responds to end-user requests. Elevators, also known as lifts or cars, are the focal point of this design. Synchronous inputs guide the operation of the controller, ensuring it functions at a fixed frequency. The RTL design undergoes verification before being implemented. The focus of this project is the modelling of a real-time three-lift controller using Verilog HDL code, leveraging a Finite-State Machine (FSM) model to optimize the logic.

Here's the Mealy machine diagram for the project
